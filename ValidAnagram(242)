//Leetcode: 242... Here there are two strings named s and t. We need to find that whether the two strings are anagram. If its anagram then we want to return true else return false.
// Anagram means if the letters are jumbled from the given word it must form other word it must be same length of string and the letter frequency must be same.
// In order to do that task, we will convert the given string to a character array and sort it alphabetically and check whether the two arrays are equal or not. If its equal then we return true else return false.
// We can give another condition that if the length of both strings will not match then it can be terminated directly.
